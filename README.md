What Is a Hat?
Hats are head coverings that can be worn casually, for protection from the weather, or for special occasions, such as religious ceremonies and high-profile events. They can be made from different materials; you can have plastic, cotton, wool, or felt hats. And both men and women wear hats, though men’s hats were more commonly required during the first half of the twentieth century.
Much like a crown proclaims royal birth, hats can indicate social status. Headwear can also be an indicator of one’s job, with many police and military officers, postal service workers, and religious figures wearing a hat as part of their uniforms.https://comfortarians.com/
A Brief History of Hats
It’s unclear when and where hats originated, but some of the earliest depictions trace back to Ancient Egypt.
•	Ancient Egypt: Some of the most common and earliest depictions of hats were from Thebes, Egypt, in 3200 BCE. As many upper-class Egyptians maintained shaved heads, headdresses were worn to keep them cool.
•	Roman Empire: Hats — such as the skull-like cap, pileus — were worn in Rome. The Phrygian cap, worn by formerly enslaved Greeks and Romans, became a symbol of freedom during the American Revolution and the French Revolution.
•	The Middle Ages: Hats became a marker of status and were used to target certain groups. The Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 required Jewish people to identify themselves with specific hats and other garments.
•	Rise of milliners: The term “milliner” was first used in the sixteenth century. The word became more common by the eighteenth century as the best hats were made in Milan, Italy.
•	Women’s fashion: Prior to the nineteenth century, women largely wore handkerchiefs or loose bonnets. In the first half of the 1800s, these bonnets became larger and more ornate with various trimmings. By the end of the century, more styles were created for women.
•	Modern use of hats: Hats were a common and expected facet of men’s fashion through the 1960s. Today, most hats are worn casually as a fashion accessory. However, there are a few high-profile social events where hats continue to be worn, such as horse racing. Royal Ascot in Britain and the Kentucky Derby in the US require attendees to wear hats.
